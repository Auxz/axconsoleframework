# AxConsoleFramework
A single header file library intended to make creating interactive and DOS-style menus in C++ console applications an after thought, including support for both Windows and Linux systems.
## Planned features and goals:
Object oriented and extremely easy to use.\
Small and portable, drag and drop into projects.\
Keyboard-interactive menus that require little setup.\
Use control character sequences to improve cross-platform compatibility.\


**Currently a work in progress**
